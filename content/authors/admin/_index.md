I promote and support open access publishing practices at IUPUI. These include the IUPUI Open Access Policy, as well as the library's open access publishing fund, open journal system and institutional repository initiatives. In addition to advocating for new forms of scholarly communication, I provide education and consultation services relevant to copyright, authorship, research metrics, and promotion and tenure.

Prior to joining University Library, I worked as an embedded librarian in the IU Center for Bioethics, where I managed a special collection of bioethics resources while collaborating on information ethics, research ethics, community engagement and health policy projects.

I bike to work, run to breathe, grapple with poetry, and make my own kimchi.
